# Third-party notice: German word frequencies

loomux embeds `internal/brain/model/zipf/de.txt.gz`, a table derived from the
German word frequencies of wordfreq 3.1.1 by Robyn Speer
(<https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq>), Copyright 2022 Robyn Speer. It holds
the Zipf frequency class of every word the chopped-word judge asks about, and
the raw frequency of the keys that carry digits.

The table is an adaptation of wordfreq's data and is licensed under the
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license
(CC BY-SA 4.0, <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>), as the data
it derives from. It is not covered by loomux's own license. `generate.py` in
the same directory rebuilds it.

What follows is quoted from wordfreq's README, version 3.1.1.
