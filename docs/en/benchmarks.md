# Benchmarks

Chronological performance measurements for loomux, cold and warm.

## 2026-09-14 16:05 — Baseline Measurement (Predecessor Binaries)

Measured on Windows x86_64, warm median over 5 runs. Basis for the Loomux fusion target budgets.

| Case | Predecessor Runtime | Time | Loomux Target Budget |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `ulguard --root` (PreToolUse, Edit) | Go (`ulguard.exe` 6.0 MB) | 33 ms | < 35 ms |
| `brain guard` | Go (`brain.exe` 13.7 MB) | 72 ms | unified in `hook pre-tool-use` |
| Both guards parallel (as seen by edit) | Go + Go | 73 ms | < 35 ms (unified in-process) |
| Both guards sequential (CPU time) | Go + Go | 114 ms | < 35 ms |
| Go cold-start floor (`brain version`, `ulinit --version`) | Go (`ulinit.exe` 8.5 MB) | 32–34 ms | ~32 ms |
| `ulguard hook session-start` | Go | 67 ms | < 100 ms (Stage 2) |
| `ultraloom hook subagent-start` | Python (with/without `uv run`) | 706–730 ms | < 100 ms (Go port) |
| `brain-mcp --help` | Python | 898 ms | < 35 ms (Go port) |
| `brain-mcp status` / `brain status` | Python / Go | 3,113 ms / 36 ms | < 35 ms |
| `brain-mcp search` / `brain search` | Python / Go | 7,773 ms / 242 ms | < 50 ms |

### Key Findings
1. Binary size does not dictate start time: `brain.exe` (13.7 MB) starts in 32 ms, `ulinit.exe` (8.5 MB) in 34 ms, `ulguard.exe` (6.0 MB) in 33 ms.
2. Start-time floor is governed strictly by package `init()` execution and embedded data parsing, not binary bytes.
3. Python hooks and CLI bridges incurred 700–3,000 ms overhead, eliminated by the unified Go binary.
